/*
 * Your job is to write a program for a speed camera. For simplicity, ignore the details such as camera,
 *  sensors, etc and focus purely on the logic. Write a program that asks the user to enter the speed limit.
 *   Once set, the program asks for the speed of a car. If the user enters a value less than the speed limit, 
 *   program should display Ok on the console. If the value is above the speed limit, the program should
 *    calculate the number of demerit points. For every 5km/hr above the speed limit, 1 demerit points 
 *    should be incurred and displayed on the console. If the number of demerit points is above 12,
 *     the program should display License Suspended.
