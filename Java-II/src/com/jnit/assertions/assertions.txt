//to confirm that ur code is working as per developer assumptions
//assertion statements will not executed in production(we disable assertions)
assert booleanExpression;
assert booleanExpression : ErrorMessage;(error message will be thrown when the expression is false)
//types of assertions
-Invariant assertion -> validates ur assumption on some local property of a method
-Class Invariant(property) -> validates ur assumption on object state
-Control flow assertion -> switch cases(assume ur flow will not go to a certian path)
-Pre conditional assertions -> for private methods(public method -> call a private method(provide an assumption to invoke that private method))
-Post conditional assertion -> public methods and we generally assert the result

-Never test ur method inputs using assertions, throw an IllegalArgumentException
-Added to Java 1.4
- ea or enableassertions as VM parameter
