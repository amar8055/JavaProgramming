Input/Output
--java.io package
-File class (java.io.File)
 - file itself, directory
 - new File("path of the file");(C:/users/appi/a.txt);
-Absolute vs relative path (a.txt,/appi/a.txt, ../../a.txt)
--Streams(I/O streams) -
-Byte Streams - byte and binary formats
-Character Streams -strings and characters, works well with textual data
----Builtin streams
-System.out
-System.in
-Sytem.err

--Low level vs High level streams
-low level stream directly interacts with the file system
-high level stream wraps the low level stream and can also take a high level stream as input
ex: BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("abc.txt"));
    ObjectInputStream os = new ObjectInputStream(new BufferedInputStream(new FileInputStream("abc.txt"));)
--we can not mix readers,writers,inutstreams,outputstreams and use them
ex: BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileWriter());
    BufferedInputStream stream = new BufferedInputStream(new FileOutputStream());
    
--closing streams is important to prevent resource leaks
--flushing the stream with flush()
--marking the stream with mark(int) and reset()
--skipping over data with skip(int)
