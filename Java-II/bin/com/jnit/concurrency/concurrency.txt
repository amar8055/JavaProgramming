1.Process
2.Thread
3.Thread types
4.Thread Scheduler(may employ round robin schedule to provide equal cpu cycles for your threads) and Context Switch
5.Thread Priorities
6.Creation of threads - extends Thread and Creating Runnable
  -Creating deamon thread
7.Thread execution Sequence
8.Thread sleep
9.Thread priority and Join
10.Executor Service - creating single thread executor, shutdown,shutdownNow 
11. Submitting tasks to executor with submit and execute
12.Callable vs Runnable
Concurrent Collection classes
Parallel streams

Cyclic barrier -> t1, t2, t3...

Fork and Join - RecursiveTask -> T compute, RecursiveAction -> void -> compute
ForkAndJoinPool -> CPU count
