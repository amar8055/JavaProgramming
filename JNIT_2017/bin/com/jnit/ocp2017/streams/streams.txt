Stream -> continous flow of data
finite stream -> stops at some point(ends with a terminal operation)
infinite stream -> runs infinite

Finite streams 
- Intermediate Operations
- Terminal Operations

Stream -> assembly process of anything

Animal Exhibit -> painted signed

-blank paint signs
-a person places an order for signs
-opens the box
-paint the sign
-write the messages
-ship them to the desired animal exhibits
-put the sign in the appropriate place - terminal operation
